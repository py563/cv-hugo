description: "In the DCU Innovation Context as part of Difference Maker initiative at UMass Lowell, we presented our idea as a pitch to Digital Federal Credit Union CEO and board members. It was designed to be on add-on to Traditional Banking setup which achieves the task paying bills (not only typical credit cards or phone bills but everything) automatically never dealing with overdrafts or late fees after setting up the profile in five minutes. The tool also produced smart artificially intelligent categorized expenditure charts and budgeting."
