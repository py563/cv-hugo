Afew days back out of boredom, I went through posts eternally on a blog maintained by bachelor classmates. Two posts intrigued most one drafted by me and another by Almeen, which prompted me to message him on Facebook after monthsâ€‹.



Gee, it felt like Facebook is too heavy to even message a friend when he is neither active nor in the news feed. Which was populated prominently with commercials and film trailers, and videos but not the status updates of friends except for one?  ðŸ˜„



Time passed on endlessly, with the CPU working hard to make a USB bootable for a friend using UNetBootin. The fan fuming out the heat reminded the Vizag steel plant blast furnace, that I visited in 2004. It might seem strange to remember a trip from ten years back, but I do remember that trip vividly due to reasons.



The night continued unlike seeing Doctor Who on Netflix (you can binge it as of 2020 on Amazon Prime in America and Hotstar in India before it disappears to HBOMAX) as it was routine from the past month. But with me searching for a supermarket store where i tried to work for few days
in Bangalore without a name or an email, just the block where it is located in JP Nagar, yet couldn't find more about it or on maps. 



Although, I found long last few project files, memories from BITS, and the UnitedCSE blog. This went on till 6 AM with me trying to login to that blog. With the blog's login email address, which was the fruit of a huge data mining project on my Gmail inbox.
