I planned to relocate as a resident to Canada from the USA after living for about six years in Boston, MA. In this **[IELTS learning blog](https://ielts.awashedupnerd.in/)**, I review the resources that were helpful in improving writing skills and other free learning series on the internet which were promising and guided me to attain 8 and 9 bands. The blog is built on popular static static genarator framework **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)** from an open sourced theme.
